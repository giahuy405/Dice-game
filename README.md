# Game Dice ( also support responsive for mobile, tablet )

## Game law 🥸: 
- The sum of the dices are over from 12 -> Big ( in the game means "XỈU" ) 
- The sum of the dices are less than 12 -> Small ( in the game means "TÀI" )
- If you choose "TÀI" and the sum of the dices are over 12 -> you win and vice versa

## Note 🧐:
- This is just a fun game. I created to study Redux. Everyone can use it to play the online game. I'm very glad that my app can help someone. 
- Not for betting 🤣. Thanks you for using it.
